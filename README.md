# libsodium-kalium-playground

This is a set of examples illustrating the power 
of [kalium](https://github.com/abstractj/kalium) - Java binding 
to the [libsodium](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/) library,
which provides the state-of-the-art cryptography via easy and compact API.

## Running examples

To download all required dependencies just build the project with Maven (JDK 1.8 required):
```
mvn clean install
```

Each example has its own `main` function to provide an easy way of running it locally.

Have fun!
